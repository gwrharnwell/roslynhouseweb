                    <p>
                        We run a B&B because we like doing it so you know when you come to stay that you are with people who are doing what they want to do, not what they have to.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We both spent our working lives in close contact with the public, and we have a sound understanding of what customers want. They want what we want, value for money, a friendly environment, comfort and genuine support when it’s needed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We like crisply ironed cotton bed linen, and so that’s what we put on our guest beds. We don’t like little plastic pots of long life milk, so we only give our guests flasks of fresh milk on their hospitality trays.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We cannot do everything, but what we can do we do as well as we can.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here’s hoping to meet you in the near future.
                    </p>

                Warm welcome from Judith and Bob. Courtesy call to confirm our time of arrival. Really comfy bed which is not usually the case which lead to a very restful stay. Little extras of sweets/chocolate and fresh milk were very welcome. Would certainly recommend and will return
